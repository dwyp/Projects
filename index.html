                    <h1>Software Craftsmanship Guild Management Application</h1>
                    <p>This project was created as a capstone project for the 12 week Java bootcamp
                        at the Software Craftsmanship Guild.  The application allows management and tracking
                        of all students (potential, current and past), cohorts, hiring partners and employers
                        and users of the application.  This is a full stack application with a MySQL database,
                        Java and Spring for the logic and controller, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front end.  
                        The project uses Spring Security to handle roles and logins, dynamically changing the 
                        view depending on permissions of the user.  Two users have been set up, admin and view.  The
                        admin user has all permissions, while the view user can only view information.  The passwords
                        for both users are currently set to password.</p>
