                    <p>The MySQL database is accessed by a Spring dependency injected DAO using JDBCTemplate.  It contains all the jobs ever read by
                        the feed reader.  Expired jobs are shown in their own tab on the view.  The database is also used for keyword searches.</p>

                    <h2>Java and Spring</h2>
                    <p>The code was written in Java, driven by Agile methodologies and Test Driven Development.  Tests were 
                        written for all implementations of the DAO and logic classes and a test database was created and used.  
                        The ROME tools library was used for reading the ATOM feed from OSU.  Spring was used as the MVC, 
                        injecting dependancies and handling controller aspects.</p>
